                            <p>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Mahavidyalaya, Peth Vadgaon, Dist. Kolhapur was founded on  June 14, 1982.  The College is run by the Jayprakash Education Society and it is the only College run by it.  The founder of the College, Hon’ble Nanasaheb Mane, Former Deputy Collector and Ex. MLA, realized the urgent need of higher education in Peth Vadgaon and its vicinity.  The bulk of the student’s form these areas were deprived of the facility of Higher Education especially the girls and the students from weaker strata of the society.  Due to their financial constraints, they were unable to go to nearby cities like Warananagar, Kolhapur, Ichalkaranji and Sangli for higher education. To provide Higher Education to them and to pay the debt of the society, the Hon’bleChairman set up this college.  This aim has been fulfilled, to a great extent.

The Jr. College is attached to the senior wing.  The College runs Arts, Commerce programs on the grant-in- aid basis and BCA course on self-financing basis. The vocational courses like Fashion Designing, Computer Course and Library Course are started by the institution.  Sufficient infrastructure is made available to run all the courses.  The institution has got permanent affiliation in Feb.2005 and is included in the UGC’s 2f and12B Act in June 2006.  After that the institution has built up separate library building and women’s hostel.  The College is situated in 20 acres of land. Two boar wells, sufficient infrastructure, the Library Building, AC Computer Lab, Gymkhana, Women’s hostel and Eco friendly atmosphere are the assets of the College.</p>
